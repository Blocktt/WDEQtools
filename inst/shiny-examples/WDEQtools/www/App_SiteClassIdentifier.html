<p>This function allows the user to upload station information and determine to which site class (HiN or LoN) a site belongs. Sites are assigned to site classes using the watershed-scale mean lithological nitrogen content (NWs) from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset-0">StreamCat</a>. <strong>See Instructions tab for input dataset guidelines.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sites with NWs &gt;= 0.089 % are classified as <strong>HiN</strong></li>
<li>Sites with NWs &lt; 0.089 % are classified as <strong>LoN</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, sites will be assigned the appropriate BFIcat (catchment-scale Base Flow Index) based on the COMID. BFIcat for each site is necessary for sample adjustment of the pt_BC_12_adj metric. <strong>See Background tab for metric calculations.</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps to the left to upload a site &amp; COMID table. For more information on the derivation of these site classes, please read the <a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/IDEMtools/Reports">IDEM Diatom IBI report</a>. Feel free to download an <a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/IDEMtools/Example_Files">Example file</a> to understand how the function works.</p>
